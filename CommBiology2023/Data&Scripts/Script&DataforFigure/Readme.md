Neuronal Selectivity For Stimulus Information Determines Prefrontal LFP Gamma Power  Regardless of Task Execution
This respository contains matlab scripts, Raw LFPs and processed data that were used for figures and statistical analysis.
The temporal axis of the LFPs is algin with Cue stimulus, the first 500 samples of LFP as inter-trial-interval and thereafter fixation for 1 sec and cue stimulus so on, as we discribed in Figure 1.
